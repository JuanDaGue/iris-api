# Iris Classification API

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for creating a Machine Learning model using the Iris dataset, deploying it via a FastAPI RESTful API, and containerizing the application with Docker.

## **Features**
- Train a classification model (e.g., Decision Tree) using the Iris dataset.
- Serve predictions through a FastAPI-based API.
- Containerized with Docker for easy deployment.
